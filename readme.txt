= How Buy Now Plus Works =

We've built a secure, robust, cloud-based payment system (buynowplus.com) that our WordPress plugin uses to process payments with Stripe.

This is great news for you because you won't ever have to worry about security or PCI compliance on your webserver.

Buy Now Plus is ultra-simple to get setup ... it doesn't require your site to be hosted with a dedicated IP address or to have an SSL certificate installed.

After your user fills out and Submits the Buy Now form they will be redirected to our secure servers to checkout. Once the checkout is complete (or the user cancels), the user will be redirected back to your site to a customizable thank you page.

= Pricing =

We're committed to making this the easiest to use payment solution for WordPress available so we've set it up so you'll only be charged for using this service when you make money.

Using our secure servers with Stripe costs 5.9% + 30¢ per successful transaction.

The fee above already includes Stripe's fee (2.9% + 30¢) -- we just add an
additional 3% for the use of our secure servers -- which makes a grand total of 4.9% + 30¢ per successful transaction.

= Why is there a small fee (in addition to Stripe's fees) when using Buy Now Plus in the first place? =

Unlike other stripe payment plugins for WordPress, Buy Now Plus does not require you to install an SSL Certificate on your site. This is because we use our secure servers to process payments through Stripe. Our servers cost money to maintain & secure ... hence, we must charge a small fee for this service.

So before using this plugin you just have to do the math. For some users the small per transaction fee will be a cost savings (particularly for those who's web host charge for SSL) and for others, the convenience / ease of use of Buy Now Plus will be worth the small fee.

= How can I run test transactions through this system? =

When you create a payment form with Buy Now Plus you can easily specify whether transactions created with it should be test or live transactions (using the livemode attribute). There are no fees (from Stripe or our servers) for running test transactions.

We recommend setting up forms initially in test mode to get the payment flow working properly before charging real transactions. Once you're satisfied that the payment flow works for you then it's easy to set the form to live by changing the value of the livemode attribute from "false" to "true".
